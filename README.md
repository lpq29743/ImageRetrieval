# Image Retrieval

The goal of this repository is to implement image retrieval in traditional machine learning methods and deep learning methods (in Pytorch).

Actually, I do this project just for my multimedia lecture. I'm majoring in Natural Language Processing rather than Computer Vision. Everyone who is interested in this repo is welcome.
